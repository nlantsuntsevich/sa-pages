I’m a freelance food photographer, content creator, food stylist, and recipe developer passionate about all things related to food and beverages, especially healthy vegetarian and vegan foods, and desserts. With work experience in speciality coffee (my favourite hobby) I professionally make and shoot all sorts of coffee-based drinks

I develop easy and delicious recipes for my clients and tailor the content to their needs, whether it’s photography or video for their social media campaigns and brand collaborations

I also make product photography for product packaging, websites and print advertising

My style is characterised by its bright, bold, and colourful aesthetics, yet clean and modern look. I pay close attention to details, showcase textures and convey the vibrant flavours of food through my images

My video and photo content is featured on the media of the largest UK supermarkets and marketplaces (Waitrose, M&S, Sainsbury’s, Ocado, Amazon), including their websites, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and their advertising on Instagram and Pinterest
